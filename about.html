			Hi, my name is Chedy Missaoui (pronounced Shedy), I live in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qCdhBm22sL52">Béja, Tunisia</a>. I aspire to become a business savvy technical dominator but currently I’m specializing in building ASP.NET Core web applications and I am currently building a commodity software development business around this expertise.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since very early in my career I’ve been interested in producing meaningful quality work swiftly, I discovered along the way that a mix of deep technical knowledge, an awareness of best practices and a pragmatic attitude towards building software/infrastructure is the way to go.
		</p>
		<p>
			After <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chedy-missaoui#experience">six years of studies and internships</a> from which I gained a considerable experience, I realized that I wanted to build a business rather than working for someone else, that’s why I am aiming at leveling up my business skills that have been very underdeveloped in the past.
		</p>
		<p>
			One year as passed now since I’ve started my freelancing business and so far I managed to deliver successfully to my previous (and first) customer. Today I am looking forward for more fruitful collaborations.
		</p>
