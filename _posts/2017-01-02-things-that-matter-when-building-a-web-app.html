<p>A few years ago I started building web applications, I discovered since then that building high quality software is hard; a lot of concerns need to be addressed.</p>
<p>I am currently specializing in ASP.NET Core and I am exploring how this platform can help in building exceptional web applications, in this post I am sharing a list of questions worth considering when aiming to achieve technical domination and customer success.</p>
<h2>General software practices</h2>
<ul>    
    <li>Do you have a strong build process that includes automated tests, inspections and packaging?</li>
    <li>Do you version control your source code?</li>
    <li>Do you have an issue tracker?</li>
    <li>Do you have a WIKI?</li>
    <li>Do you run continuous integration?</li>
    <li>Do you practice software design?</li>
    <li>Do you write clean code?</li>
    <li>Do you have a fast feedback loop?</li>
    <li>Do you keep an eye on performance bottlenecks?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Domain model</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Does the application have a domain model expressed in software that depends only on: the language, its standard library, interfaces and classes that are defined in the domain layer?</li>
	<li>Does your domain model enforce data constraints? All of them? Some of them? None of them? Do you make it explicit?</li>
	<li>Have you considered the fact that your domain model might be used in a concurrent, parallel, distributed fashion?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web application</h2>
<ul>   
    <li>Do you leverage your framework scaffolding capabilities for generating CRUD code (HTML+C#)? Are you aware of how much time can be saved by using a scaffolder? Do you understand the code generated by your scaffolder?</li>
    <li>Are you able to use complex data bindings?</li>
    <li>Do you design your urls to be legit Restfull resources?</li>
    <li>Do you enforce AAA(Authenication, Authorization and Accounting) on your application? Do you understand the mechanisms provided by ASP.NET Identity? </li>
    <li>Do you have a comprehensible, efficient and non-clunky way for logging the webapp activity?</li>
    <li>Do you treat your javascript code as an important artifact that needs to be inspected and tested and reviewed?</li>
    <li>Did you made sure to integrate a css preprocessor in your workflow? Are you even aware of the productivity boost associated with it?</li>
    <li>Do you pay attention to your pages load speed on the client side? Do you minify static resources? Optimize images? Use a CDN? Do you lazy load static resources whenever relevant?</li>
    <li>Do you use CSRF tokens and perform validations on input?</li>
    <li>Do you properly encode server output?</li>
    <li>Do you have a solid strategy for handling session state?</li>
    <li>Do you have a solid strategy for Data caching?</li>
    <li>Do you make sure to wrap your Domain Models into View Models to keep them free of UI specific stuff?</li>
    <li>Do you make sure that your application does not hoard unused dependencies(Nuget/npm/bower)?</li>
    <li>Do you make sure that your webapp is compatible across browser and that it is responsive?</li>
    <li>Do you use SSL at all?</li>
    <li>Do you have a localization/internationalization strategy?</li>
    <li>Do you understand how the ASP.NET platform handles request (and how it creates threads for each request maybe)?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Databases</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Do you use an ORM, a lightweight ORM or direct SQL queries? And Why?</li>
    <li>Have you considered NoSQL alternatives?</li>
    <li>Do you use connection pooling for 3rd party services in general?</li>
    <li>If using SQL, do you have a normalized schema that maintains data integrity?</li>
    <li>Do you make sure to optimize queries?</li>
    <li>Do you use prepared statements? Do you make sure to avoid SQL injections?</li>
    <li>Do you use some transaction mechanism to ensure atomicity of writes that requires multiple steps?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Have you considered how you webapp is going to be operated?</li>
    <li>Did you build monitoring and logging capabilities that will allow to XRay the application while it runs?</li>
    <li>Did you designed a deployment model that will allow the application to scale linearly by adding servers or by buying better servers?</li>
    <li>Have you set up continuous deployment process?</li>
    <li>Did you made sure that your application is stable no matter what crazy conditions you throw at it?</li>
    <li>Did you plan for reliability and capacity?</li>
</ul>
