<p>In a recent asp.net core project, I needed to create a somewhat complex list editor widget and I decided to encapsulate it in a tag helper.</p>

<p>Since it would be painful to build the widget's content using interpolated strings under the tag helper's <code>Process</code> method, I started searching for a way to render a cshtml template similar to what <code>@Html.Partial</code> providers but usable inside the <code>Process</code> method.</p>

<p>After doing some googling in vain, I posted an <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/5504">issue on the asp.net core Mvc project</a> to suggest adding a mechanism for rendering cshtml templates from tag helpers. <a href="https://github.com/frankabbruzzese">frankabbruzzese</a> pointed out then in the discussion that it was possible to get a working <code>IHtmlHelper</code> inside a custom tag helper and to use its <code>IHtmlHelper.Partial</code> method.</p>

<p>In this post we are going to see how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>get and properly initialize an <code>Htmlhelper</code> in a custom tag helper</li>
<li>pass data to the cshtml template</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual the full project code is <a href="https://github.com/MissaouiChedy/UsingCshtmlTemplatesInTagHelpers">available on Github</a>. But first off let's discuss why you should not do this.</p>
<h2>Razor view components</h2>
<p>When I was building the list editor widget I was not aware of the new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/view-components">Razor View Component</a> mechanism , which basically allows to render a partial template, to pass it data and to do some processing before the actual rendering.</p> 
<p><strong>It seems that using View Components is a cleaner approach</strong> as we are going to see in an upcoming post.</p>
<p>But still one might need to use an <code>HtmlHelper</code> inside a tag helper maybe for some reason I am not anticipating. That's why I want to share what I learned.</p>

<h2>Getting an IHtmlHelper through Dependency Injection and properly initializing it</h2>
<p>By using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection">dependency injection mechanism</a> in asp.net core it is possible to get an <code>IHtmlHelper</code> instance, the only catch is that the provided instance is not ready for use; it needs to be contextualized i.e. to be set with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.rendering.viewcontext#Microsoft_AspNetCore_Mvc_Rendering_ViewContext"><code>ViewContext</code></a> object of the view in which the tag helper is rendered.</p>
<p> This is achieved by the <code>(htmlHelper as IViewContextAware).Contextualize(ViewContext);</code> statement which needs the current <code>ViewContext</code> instance.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/MissaouiChedy/e5991c20ced340656347553e11d5d4e9.js"></script>
<p>In the previous example the TagHelper constructor will be used by the dependency injection context to provide an <code>IHtmlHelper</code> instance and the <code>ViewContext</code> property slapped with the <code>[ViewContext]</code> attribute will be populated by the current ViewContext. Notice how the html helper is contextualized at the start of the <code>ProcessAsync</code> method.
<p>
	The <code>HtmlHelper</code> is then used to render a cshtml view (<code>~/Views/Shared/Template.cshtml</code> in the example), by calling the <code>HtmlHelper.Partial</code> method.
</p>
<h2>Passing data to the view</h2>
<p>Passing data to the razor view is similar to passing data to the <a href="vc.controller#Microsoft_AspNetCore_Mvc_Controller_View_System_String_System_Object_"><code>Controller.View</code></a> method, you have basically 3 ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>passing a model object to a strongly typed view</li>
	<li>populating the <code>ViewData</code> dictionary</li>
	<li>populating the <code>ViewBag</code> expando object</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Under the tag helper <code>ProcessAsync</code> method it is possible to use the <code>ViewData</code> and <code>ViewBag</code> properties contained in the <code>HtmlHelper</code> instance.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/MissaouiChedy/f3ad7e27db8b79fe59fa38e90393e718.js"></script>
<p>Notice how the model as been passed explicitly and how the <code>ViewData</code> and its expando object facade the <code>ViewBag</code> are passed implicitly. The data is then accessed in the rendered razor partial template as in the following example:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/MissaouiChedy/e5d8b21f4a755e368118180072ea180b.js"></script>
<h3>Creating a new ViewData dictionary instance</h3>
<p>One last thing: While creating the list editor widget, I had to actually create a new instance of the <code>ViewData</code> dictionary instead of using the one in the <code>HtmlHelper</code> instance. I will skip the details of the issue I encountered in the interest of brievety.</p>
<p>In asp.net core the most convenient constructor that allows to create an instance "from scratch" in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.viewfeatures.viewdatadictionary"><code>ViewDataDictionary</code></a> class has the following signature: <code>ViewDataDictionary(IModelMetadataProvider metadataProvider, ModelStateDictionary modelState)</code>.</p>
<p>The required <code>IModelMetadataProvider</code> instance can be requested through dependency injection and the <code>ModelStateDictionary</code> can be instantiated by using its parameterless constrcutor.</p>
