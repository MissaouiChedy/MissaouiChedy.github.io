You would have a hard time finding a programmer who would confess that they use a cheat sheet from time to time. But the reality is that everyone uses them. In fact, even the most seasoned programmers cannot remember every keyword, function name or tag (in the case of markup languages) of any given programming language. That is where cheat sheets come into play.

Cheat sheets provide an efficient way for programmers to quickly look-up the capabilities of a programming language. They are just as useful for novice programmers as they are to veteran ones, as one could swiftly grasp the basics of a programming language and how it’s written. All of this is true, but only if the cheat sheet in question is well-constructed. A bad cheat sheet, on the other hand, is much more likely to waste the time for experienced programmers.

Today, we bring you one of the most important tools you’ll ever come across as a web developer: the ultimate HTML cheat sheet by [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/html-cheat-sheet){:target="_blank"}.
