The [Partition Receiver](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/samples/Sample05_ReadingEvents.md#read-events-from-a-partition-using-the-partitionreceiver) is a yet another event consuming alternative available in the Azure Event Hubs .NET SDK.

From all the options, `PartitionReceiver` is the lowest level of abstraction available before raw AMQP connections.

In this post, we will explore the basic concepts and the main benefits of Partition Receiver.

<i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Full working sample** [is available on Github as usual](https://github.com/MissaouiChedy/BlogSamples/tree/main/AzureEventHubsPartitionReceiver)

## Principle

Partition receiver enables developers to consume events from a **specific partition** and starting from a **specific position** in the event stream, consider the following snippet from the sample:

```csharp
/*
 * 1 - Create an event hubs parition receiver
 */

var receiver = new PartitionReceiver(
  consumerGroup,
  firstParition,
  EventPosition.Earliest,
  eventhubNamespace,
  eventhubName,
  new DefaultAzureCredential()
);

using CancellationTokenSource cancellationSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
...
try
{
  /*
    * 2 - Read events from the partition while cancellation not requested
    */
  while (!cancellationSource.IsCancellationRequested)
  {
    /*
     * 3 - Define Events Batch Size and Pulling Window
     */
    int batchSize = 10;
    TimeSpan eventPullingSpan = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);

    /*
      * 4 - Perform the actual read from the event stream
      */
    IEnumerable<EventData> eventBatch = await receiver.ReceiveBatchAsync(
        batchSize,
        eventPullingSpan,
        cancellationSource.Token);

    foreach (EventData eventData in eventBatch)
    {
      /* 5 - Process events batch */
      ...
    }
    ...
  }
}
catch (TaskCanceledException)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Consumption Canceled !");
}
finally
{
  await receiver.CloseAsync();
  ...
}
```

First, we start by create a `ParitionReceiver` instance, pointing on a specific partition and specific event position in the stream.

We define then a loop in which `ParitionReceiver.ReceiveBatchAsync` is going to be called continuously.

When calling `ParitionReceiver.ReceiveBatchAsync`, we provide a *batch size* and a *pulling timespan*.

`ParitionReceiver.ReceiveBatchAsync` will wait the *pulling timespan* and return a maximum of *batch size* events.

For example, if called with a batch size of 10 and pulling time span of 2 seconds, then it will return maximum of 10 events not yet consumed and available for consumption during the 2 seconds.
<div class="img-container">
![Partition receiver Pulling Example](/imgs/PartitionReceiverPullingExample.png)
</div>

In the previous illustrated example, initially we have ev4, ev5, and ev6 available for pulling. 

During the 2 seconds pulling span, ev7 was received, meaning that `ReceiveBatchAsync` will return `[ev4, ev5, ev6, ev7]` as the received batch.

## Benefits

Partition receiver is simple and rudimentary, it allows simply to read from a single partition making it not suitable for most cases.

However, **trading off comprehensiveness,** it still has some benefits that can be useful in some situations.

### Predictability

**Resource usage** mainly in the form of [AMQP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-amqp-protocol-guide) links creation is predictable with `PartitionReceiver` since we have exactly 1 AMQP link related to the lifetime of one `PartitionReceiver` instance.

In addition, there is no implicit background pulling managed by the SDK, receiving events is done via an explicit call bringing **network usage** predictability.

`PartitionReceiver` was initially created to [provide a stateful consumer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/design/proposal-partition-receiver.md) with the previous two properties while encapsulating consumer state composed of:
 - Event hubs namespace
 - Topic
 - Consumer group
 - Partition
 - Starting position and current position in the partition

### Concurrent Consumers from same partition

In previous posts, we already mentioned that with Event hubs we can't have several consumer clients consuming from the same partition [by design.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-processor-balance-partition-load#partition-ownership)

I was surprised üò≤ to discover that with `PartitionReceiver`, it was actually possible to have **multiple consumer clients consuming from the same partition** but in different parts of the event stream.

Consider the `AzureEventHubsPartitionReceiver.MultipleReceivers` example from our sample:
```csharp
/*
 * Create an event hubs partition receiver
 * receiving from latest event in the event stream
 */

var latestReceiver = new PartitionReceiver(
  consumerGroup,
  firstParition,
  EventPosition.Latest,
  ...
);

/*
 * Create an event hubs partition receiver
 * receiving from range of events in the event stream
 */
var rangeReceiver = new PartitionReceiver(
  consumerGroup,
  firstParition,
  EventPosition.FromSequenceNumber(500), // starting position
  ...
);
...
/*
 * Launch two receivers concurrently
 */

Task[] tasks = [
  Task.Factory.StartNew(() => ReceiveAsync(latestReceiver, cancellationSource).Wait()),
  Task.Factory.StartNew(() => ReceiveWithLimitAsync(
    rangeReceiver,
    cancellationSource,
    countLimit: 50)
  .Wait()),
];
...
Task.WaitAll(tasks);
```

Here we created two receivers that starts concurrently:
- `latestReceiver` receiving the latest events
- `rangeReceiver` receiving a count of events from a starting sequence number

Taking a look at each corresponding event receiving method:

```csharp
async Task ReceiveAsync(
  PartitionReceiver receiver,
  CancellationTokenSource cancellationSource)
{
  ...
  try
  {
    while (!cancellationSource.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
      int batchSize = 10;
      TimeSpan eventPullingSpan = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);

      IEnumerable<EventData> eventBatch = await receiver
        .ReceiveBatchAsync(
          batchSize,
          eventPullingSpan,
          cancellationSource.Token);

      foreach (EventData eventData in eventBatch)
      {
        ...
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}

async Task ReceiveWithLimitAsync(
    PartitionReceiver receiver, 
    CancellationTokenSource cancellationSource,
    int countLimit = 100)
{
  ...
  try
  {
    /* 
     * Loop breaks on countLimit
     */
    while (!cancellationSource.IsCancellationRequested
        && (eventCount < countLimit))
    {
      int batchSize = 5;
      TimeSpan eventPullingSpan = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);

      IEnumerable<EventData> eventBatch = await receiver.ReceiveBatchAsync(
          batchSize,
          eventPullingSpan,
          cancellationSource.Token);

      foreach (EventData eventData in eventBatch)
      {
        ...
      }
    }
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

We can see that both receivers are **operating concurrently** but not on the same part of the event stream.

Again, this is not commonly needed but can be useful in some situations.

## Closing Thoughts

While partition receivers is not for most cases, it is still available from specialized and specific requirements,
you can checkout the [design document for some examples.](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/design/proposal-partition-receiver.md#high-level-scenarios)

The .NET SDK offers a comprehensive set of options to produce and consume events, but this leaves me curious about raw AMQP connections üòè
