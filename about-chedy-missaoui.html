				Hi, my name is <span id="ident">Chedy Missaoui</span> (pronounced Shedy), I am from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qCdhBm22sL52">Béja, Tunisia</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am an overall software and cloud enthusiast, currently I’m specializing in helping software development teams establish a DevOps culture.
			</p> 
				
			<p>
				I currently work as a DevOps Architect at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tessangroup/">Tessan Group</a> an awesome Tunis based company that you should totally checkout.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Since very early in my career I’ve been interested in producing meaningful quality work swiftly.
			</p> 
			
			<p>
				Early on, I discovered that a mix of deep technical knowledge, awareness of best practices and a pragmatic attitude towards building software/infrastructure yields meaningful results.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the last 5 years, I learned that strong impact is not only about technical capability but also about <strong>people getting together and collaborating effectively.</strong>
